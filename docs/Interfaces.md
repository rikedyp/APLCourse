# External Interfaces
In an ideal world, we'd spend our entire lives blissfully in the warm comfort of the APL session. All of our data would magically appear and we would write perfect, beautiful algorithms to solve idealised problems.

In the real world, we must interface with external systems. After all, the entire point of learning this tool is to use it to solve real world problems.
